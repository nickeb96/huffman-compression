Microsoft announced Monday that it will buy GitHub, the popular coding platform
where developers share and collaborate on projects, for $7.5 billion worth of
Microsoft stocks.

The deal will strengthen the company's relationship with developers and allow
its tools to reach a broader audience within the world of open-source software,
experts say.  More than 28 million developers around the world use GitHub,
Microsoft said, acknowledging the crucial role that developers have played in
revolutionizing the modern economy.

"Today, every company is becoming a software company and developers are at the
center of digital transformation", Microsoft said in a news release.

The Redmond, Washington company, which said it is the most active organization
on GitHub, also plans to accelerate the use of the platform by businesses,
relying on its sales team, existing corporate partnerships and cloud computing
infrastructure.

GitHub will continue to remain in an open platform that is independently
operated, Microsoft said.  The tech giant's vice president of developer
services, Nat Friedman, will become the new head of GitHub.  The deal is
expected to close later this year if it passes regulatory review.

The pending acquisition arrives at a time of explosive growth for the cloud
industry.  Cloud services will account for a staggering $186 billion this year.
Up more than 21% from last year according to estimates by Gartner, an IT
research firm.  The industry is expected to continue to grow, crossing the $300
billion mark by 2021.  GitHub, analysts say, could help Microsoft seize on that
growth by drawing new developers to its cloud platform, Azure.
